Mum mum mum mah
Mum mum mum mah
Mum mum mum mah
Mum mum mum mah
Mum mum mum mah</ul>

<ul>[Verse 1]
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please (Woo)
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me (I love it)
LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart</ul>

<ul>[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

<ul>[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)</ul>

(Mum mum mum mah)</ul>

<ul>[Verse 2]
I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be (Woo)
A little gamblin' is fun when you're with me (I love it, woo)
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby, when it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun, fun</ul>

<ul>[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

<ul>[Bridge]
I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lyin', I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunnin'
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous</ul>

<ul>[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

<ul>[Intro: Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say? (Say)
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breakin' up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
K-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy), k-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy</ul>

<ul>[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play (Play)
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop callin' me, I'm kinda busy</ul>

<ul>[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor</ul>

<ul>[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephonin' me)
I'm busy
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
Stop telephonin' me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephonin' me)</ul>

<ul>[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone</ul>

<ul>[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Boy, the way you blowin' up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster (Pu-put)
Put my coat on faster (Le-leave)
Leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home
'Cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer</ul>

<ul>[Bridge: Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, Both]
It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringin'
Sometimes I feel like I live in GrandCentral S-Station (Station)
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin' (Dancin')
'Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('Cause I'll be dancin'; dancin')
'Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('Cause I'll be dancin')
'Cause tonight I'm dancin'
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin'</ul>


<ul>[Chorus: All, Lady Gaga]
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor</ul>

<ul>[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga, Beyoncé]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephonin' me)
Stop telephonin' me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
I'm busy
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephonin' me)
Stop telephonin' me, eh, eh eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)</ul>

<ul>[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone</ul>

<ul>[Outro: Lady Gaga, Darkchild]
(D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Darkchild)
My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
We're sorry- We're sorry
The number you have reached is not in service at this time
Please check the number or try your call again</ul>

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga & Akon]
I've had a little bit too much, much (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
All of the people start to rush (Start to rush by)
A dizzy twister dance, can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone (Oh, oh, oh-oh)</ul>

<ul>[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
What's goin' on, on the floor?

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? (Inside out, right)
Control your poison, babe, roses have thorns, they say
And they're all gettin' hosed tonight (Oh, oh, oh-oh)</ul>

<ul>[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
What's goin' on, on the floor?

<ul>[Verse 3: Colby O'Donis]
When I come through on the dance floor, checking out that catalogue (Hey)
Can't believe my eyes, so many women without a flaw (Hey)
And I ain't gon' give it up, steady, tryna pick it up like a call (Hey)
I'ma hit it, I'ma beat it up, latch onto it until tomorrow, yeah
Shorty, I can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirlin' up them hips 'round and 'round
And there is no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime, stay, let me watch you break it down and</ul>

<ul>[Bridge: Lady Gaga & Akon]
Go, use your muscle, carve it out, work it, hustle
